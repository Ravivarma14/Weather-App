# Notes
### Alpha Animation:
      An animation that controls the alpha level of an object. Useful for fading things in and out. This animation ends up changing the alpha property of a Transformation.

### Translate Animation:
      An animation that controls the position of an object. Initialize this animation with the dimensions of the object being animated as well as the objects parents. (This is to support animation sizes being specified relative to these dimensions.)
